title: DEI Chair
description: As DEI Chair, I look for ways to improve diversity within ACM at Santa Clara University. I work with other board members to plan events and generate ideas to foster an inclusive community as well as make ACM as much of a welcoming place as possible for everyone of all backgrounds. Previously, I served as one of the Underclassmen Representatives and ran the ACM Instagram. Pictured below is our 2024-2025 board.
