description: During the first INRIX hackathon in Seattle, my team and I designed a project to provide a seamless end-to-end experience for planning a business trip. I specifically worked with Flask to integrate the INRIX routing and parking APIs and the HERE public transit API. I also contributed to various components on the front end. With our project, we made it to the finalist round.
