title: Parking++
description: During the 2023 INRIX Hackathon, my team and I developed a web app to help people find cheaper parking near their destinations. The app integrated Google Maps and included a street view feature. Users could type in the search bar, set a radius for parking spots, and view different locations with a sidebar showing the distance from the destination, availability probability, and cost. Although the search bar and radius button were not fully completed, the rest of the app became fully functional. We hosted the web app using AWS. I specifically worked on the frontend, using Figma to design the interface, coding the search bar as a textbox, and creating a submit button in Vue.js.
