title: TreeID
description: During the 11th Annual Hack for Humanity at SCU, my team and I designed an app to help children identify trees in Yosemite National Park. We used Figma to design the app and Flutter to implement the design and add functionality. Users navigate through the app by answering a series of questions, which ultimately guide them to identify a specific type of tree based on the characteristics they select.
