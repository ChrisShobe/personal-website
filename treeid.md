title: TreeID
description: During the 11th Annual Hack for Humanity at SCU, my team and I designed an app that would help children identify trees in Yosemite park. We used Figma to design the app and Flutter to implement the design and add functionality. Users would navigate through the app answering a series of questions which would eventually lead to a certain type of tree depending on the characteristics chosen.
