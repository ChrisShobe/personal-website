    <p>November 2023</p>
    <p>During the 2023 INRIX Hackathon, my team and I came up with a webapp that would help people find cheaper parking near destinations. The webapp integrated GoogleMaps and has streetview. When users would type in the search bar and clicked a button to define the radius of parking spots they would like to view, different locations would pop up with a bar on the right that would show how far away the parking spot is from the destination, the chance that it will be available, and the cost of the spot. The search bar and radius button were not fully finished, but the rest became fully functional. We hosted the webapp using AWS. I specifically worked on the frontend using Figma to create the design and then coded the search bar to be a textbox and made a submit button on the bar in vue.js.</p>
