    <h1>Solutions Delivery Intern</h1>
    <p>In Summer 2024, I was a Solutions Delivery Intern for Innovation Team 3 (IT3), where all meetings followed Scrum and Agile methodologies. I helped maintain the corporate website using WordPress, HTML, and CSS, and assisted in updating the insured portal and guest login with TypeScript, Sass, HTML, Node.js, and Bootstrap. I presented a "Tips and Tricks" session on Microsoft Teams and Outlook to many members of Palomar and co-presented a Social Media Mascot campaign, receiving encouragement to pursue marketing. I also learned about different roles within Scrum, such as Scrum Masters, Business Analysts, QAs, and developers (the main group I was a part of). Additionally, I joined a second team, where I learned Pega and worked with Spring Boot, Java, and Selenium to enhance testing automation. Pictured below are all the Summer 2024 interns at a Beach Bash hosted by Palomar.</p>
