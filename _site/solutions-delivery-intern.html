    <h1>Solutions Delivery Intern</h1>
    <p>In Summer 2024, I was a Solutions Delivery Intern for Innovation Team 3 (IT3), where all meetings followed Scrum and Agile methodologies. I helped maintain the corporate website using WordPress, HTML, and CSS. I also helped update the insured portal and guest login with TypeScript, Sass, HTML, Node.js, and Bootstrap. I presented a tips and tricks session on Microsoft Teams and Outlook to many members of Palomar and co-presented a Social Media Mascot campaign, receiving encouragement to pursue marketing. I learned about different roles within Scrum such as Scrum Masters, Business Analysis, QAs, and developers (the main group I was a part of). Additionally, I joined a second team, learning Pega and working with Spring Boot, Java, and Selenium to enhance testing automation. Pictured below is all the Summer 2024 interns at a Beach Bash Palomar held.</p>
