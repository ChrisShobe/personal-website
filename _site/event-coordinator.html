    <h1>Event Coordinator</h1>
    <p>As an Event Coordinator, I plan interdisciplinary events throughout the year to promote entrepreneurship on campus. Previously, as an Underclassmen Representative, I contributed by taking meeting notes and brainstorming event ideas. Pictured below is our 2023-2024 board at the annual Entreprelooza event, where entrepreneurs from across the Bay Area gave talks to Santa Clara University students, encouraging participation and fostering an understanding of entrepreneurship among students from all backgrounds.</p>
