    <h1>Event Coordinator</h1>
    <p>As an Event Coordinator, I plan interdisciplinary events year-round to foster entrepreneurship on campus. Previously, as an Underclassmen Representative, I contributed by taking meeting notes and brainstorming event ideas. Pictured below is some of our 2023-2024 board at our yearly Entrepreloozza event, where entrepreneurs from across the Bay Area gave talks to Santa Clara University students, encouraging participation and learning about entrepreneurship for students from all backgrounds.</p>
