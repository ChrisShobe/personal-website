    <p>April 2024</p>
    <p>During the first-ever SCU Roblox Game Jam, my team and I made an escape room video game called Countdown to Chaos. Using Lua and Roblox Studio, our game features multiple rooms with various tasks, and the player must complete each room before a timer runs out. As time progresses, the player's vision becomes increasingly impaired, adding to the challenge. Despite none of us having any prior experience in game development, we were able to make functional rooms with interactive puzzles and working portals.</p>
