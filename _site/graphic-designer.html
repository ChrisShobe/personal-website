    <h1>Graphic Designer</h1>
    <p>SwingBeats is a startup created by Santa Clara University students. We are designing Haptic Feedback Ankle Bracelets (HFABs) to help dancers improve by signaling when to perform certain steps and providing feedback on accuracy and practice time. By integrating technology with dance, SwingBeats offers valuable insights into student progress for both dancers and instructors. I am a part of the frontend team and use Figma to design the main SwingBeats website look and layout. I plan to digitally draw all icons and work with other frontend members to implement my design through CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Pictured below is what the HFABs look like.</p>
