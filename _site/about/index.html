    <p>I am more than my major. I enjoy art, music, nature, and deep conversations.</p>

      <div class="title">Music:</div>
      <div class="text">
        Music has been a part of my life since childhood, sparked by a piano at home that inspired me to play and compose. After a few years of piano lessons, I discovered my love for the clarinet in 5th grade and focused on mastering it. Now, after nine years of playing, it remains my primary instrument. Currently, I am part of Santa Clara University's Wind Ensemble, and I hope to continue my musical journey post-graduation.

      <div class="title">Art:</div>
      <div class="text">
        Ever since I was little, I would paint with my mom. Over time, I developed an interest in realism during high school, eventually finding my true love in digital art with its boundless spectrum of colors and the ease of fixing mistakes. I love creating art and enjoy making gifts for friends and family with the pieces I create.

        I have a passion for hiking, skiing, and capturing nature through photography. I also enjoy engaging in deep conversations, particularly about philosophy and human behavior. Additionally, I'm exploring how other fields, like marketing, intersect with computer science.
