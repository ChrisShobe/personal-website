    <p>I am more than my major. I enjoy art, music, nature, and deep conversations.</p>

      <div class="title">Music:</div>
      <div class="text">
        Music has been a part of my life since childhood, with a piano at home that sparked my desire to play and compose. After a few years of piano lessons, I discovered my love for the clarinet in 5th grade and focused on mastering it. Now, after nine years of playing, it remains my primary instrument. Currently, I am a part of Santa Clara University's Wind Ensemble and I hope to continue my musical journey post-graduation.

      <div class="title">Art:</div>
      <div class="text">
        Ever since I was little I would paint with my mom. Overtime I started to get into realism in high school. Eventually I found my true love in digital art with its boundless spectrum of colors and ease of fixing mistakes. I love art and making friends and family gifts with the pieces I create.

      <div class="title">Interests:</div>
      <div class="text">
        I have a passion for hiking, skiing, and capturing nature through photography. I also enjoy engaging in deep conversations, particularly about philosophy and human behavior. Additionally, I'm exploring how other fields, like marketing, intersect with computer science, and I'm even considering pursuing a minor in it!
