    <h1>DEI Chair</h1>
    <p>As the DEI Chair, I seek to enhance diversity within ACM at Santa Clara University. I collaborate with other board members to plan events and develop initiatives that foster an inclusive community, ensuring ACM is a welcoming place for everyone, regardless of background. Previously, I served as one of the Underclassmen Representatives and managed the ACM Instagram. Pictured below is our 2024-2025 board.</p>
