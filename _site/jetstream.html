    <p>December 2023</p>
    <p>During the first INRIX hackathon in Seattle, my team and I designed a project that would provide a seemless end to end experience to plan a business trip. I specifically worked with Flask to call the INRIX routing and parking APIs and here.com public transit API. I also helped with various components on the front-end. With our project, we were able to get to the finalist round.</p>
