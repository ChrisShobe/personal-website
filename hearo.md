title: Hearo
description: Our project, Hearo, ensures emergency alerts are accessible to those who are deaf or hard of hearing. The app uses AI to detect fire alarms in real-time and instantly notifies users through vibrations and flashlight alerts on their smartphones. To handle mobile processing limitations, we offload AI analysis to a server, encrypting audio before transmission and deleting it immediately after processing. I worked implementing background functionality in Flutter and part of the UI/UX design. We were proud to integrate real-time AI-powered alerts while successfully maintaining privacy and usability.
