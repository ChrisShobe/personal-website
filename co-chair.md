title: Co-Chair
description: The IDEAS (Inclusion and Diversity in Engineering And STEM) Coalition at Santa Clara University is group of student-led organizations in STEM whose membership consists of underrepresented or minority students. IDEAS's mission is to build community and collaboration between the members of IDEAS Coalition organizations as well as to advocate for diversity and inclusion initiatives in STEM at SCU. As Co-Chair I am helping rebuild IDEAS since it slowed down due to the pandemic. I also plan IDEAS programming to create an equitable environment for all STEM students at SCU.
