title: Literally Cooking
description: At the 2024 AWS x INRIX Hackakon, my team and I developed Literally Cooking, an AI-powered app that generates "mega recipes" to help users efficiently cook two dishes simultaneously. The app optimizes appliance usage, reduces energy consumption, and simplifies meal prep by breaking tasks into manageable steps. I designed the Figma, set up the backend with Python and Boto3 to call Bedrock/Converse, and worked on prompt engineering in the AWS Playground using Claude 3 Sonnet. Additionally, I completed most of the Devpost submission and created the slide deck, slogan, and logo. While we faced challenges in training the AI model and aligning frontend-backend communication, our prototype demonstrated the app's core functionality. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of AI prompt engineering, backend integration, and the creative process of branding and presentation.
